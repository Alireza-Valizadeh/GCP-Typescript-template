# Firebase Node.js Cloud Functions Template

This repository provides a clean, structured template for building and deploying Cloud Functions for Firebase, focused on Google Cloud Platform integrations. It's designed to help developers jumpstart their Firebase projects by providing a set of pre-defined functions and configurations.

## Features

- **Predefined Data Access Layers**: Separate read and write operations for clarity and maintenance ease.
- **Validation Layer**: Includes basic validators to ensure data integrity.
- **Configuration Management**: Organized configuration files for managing environments and dependencies.
- **Testing Setup**: Pre-configured Jest setup for both unit and integration tests to ensure your code remains bug-free.
